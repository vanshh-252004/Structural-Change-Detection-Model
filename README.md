# Multimodal Approaches for Structural Change Detection in Images Using MorphologicalÂ Transformations

This project aims to evaluate the ability of multiple machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests, in detecting structural changes in images. By examining variations in pixel values and their surrounding neighborhoods, the goal is to determine whether these models can learn and recognize patterns indicative of structural shifts. The central hypothesis is that localized pixel deviations, if appropriately learned by these models, can serve as reliable indicators of image alterations. The extent of the problem's solution will be measured by the models' accuracy in identifying structural changes, thus quantifying the significance of pattern recognition in detecting such transformations.
